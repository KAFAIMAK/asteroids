<h1>Asteroids</h1>
<h2 style="font-size:20px;">Project Overview</h2>
<p>I created a simple asteroids game inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)" target="_blank">Asteroids (video game)</a>. 
    The code for the game is written in TypeScript and it uses the Observable stream to implement the observer pattern. It also follows the FRP style
    and uses SVG to model the elements in the game. 
</p>

<h3 style="font-size:20px;">Features implemented</h3>
<p> - Big asteroids break down into smaller asteroids when shot. <br>
    - Only small asteroids can be destroyed by the player's spaceship. <br>
    - Multiple lives have been implemented. <br>
    - A life is deducted and the game resets when the player's spaceship crashes into an asteroid, collides with the enemy spaceship's bullet or the enemy's spaceship. <br>
    - The game displays game over when there are no lives left and automatically refreshes the page. <br>
    - A scoring system has been implemented. (Big asteroid = 1 point, small asteroid = 2 points). <br>
    - Particles exploding effect when an asteroid has been shot. <br>
    - An enemy spaceship that shoots at the player's spaceship has been implemented. It moves with varying speed. <br>
    - Handling more than one key press.
