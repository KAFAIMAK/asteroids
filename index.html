    <p>
      The purpose of this assignment was to create an asteroids game while implementing 
      the observer pattern. The code written abides by functional programming rules and 
      is Typesafe. The Observable stream is used to observe keyboard events with causes 
      the player's ship to move and shoot bullets. Furthermore, it is also used to update 
      the state of the asteroids, bullets and enemy ship. The challenge was to ensure that 
      all functions are pure which means that there are no side effects. The code that I 
      have written however, is not completely pure as there are mutable variables required 
      for elements in the game to move such as the x, y, speed and angle attributes. Furthermore, 
      lists are used to store references of the asteroids and bullets in the game. This is 
      required to detect collisions between bullets and asteroids. I minimised the usage of 
      mutable variables whereby it is only present in the code because it is required to model
      more complex features in the cleanest way possible. <br/>

      Side-effects in the code have been minimised and contained in the Observable subscribe function. 
      Lastly, the parameter and function return types have been specified to ensure that the code is Typesafe.
